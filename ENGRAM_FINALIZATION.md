# Engram Migration Finalization Plan

## Goal
Complete the migration from ClaudeMemoryBridge (CMB) to Engram by removing all fallback code and updating documentation.

## Status
- ✅ Migrated memory adapter to support Engram (prioritizing Engram over CMB)
- ✅ Renamed main files from cmb_adapter.py to engram_adapter.py
- ✅ Created installation scripts for both Engram and legacy CMB
- ✅ Added migration tools and documentation
- ✅ Successfully tested agent creation and memory functionality

## Completed Steps

### 1. Remove CMB Fallback Code (High Priority)
- ✅ Edit `engram_adapter.py` to remove CMB fallback imports
- ✅ Simplify the adapter class to use only Engram functionality
- ✅ Remove all CMB-specific HTTP endpoint references
- ✅ Update error messages to only reference Engram
- ✅ Delete the `cmb_adapter.py` file completely

### 2. Update Documentation (High Priority)
- ✅ Update memory service docstrings to remove all CMB references
- ✅ Update comments in code to reference Engram instead of CMB
- ✅ Update README.md to remove all CMB references
- ✅ Revise MIGRATION.md to indicate it's a historical document
- ✅ Add new documentation section about Engram features

### 3. Code Cleanup (Medium Priority)
- ✅ Remove unused constants and variables related to CMB
- ✅ Rename remaining variables that reference CMB
- ✅ Delete temporary duplicate files no longer needed
- ✅ Optimize imports in all affected files
- ✅ Remove mem0ai dependencies

### 4. Testing After Removal (High Priority)
- ✅ Test Nexus agent creation works without CMB fallback
- ✅ Verify memory storage works correctly (file-based fallback)
- ✅ Verify memory storage works correctly when Engram is available
- ✅ Ensure the system gracefully handles Engram not being installed
- ✅ Identified existing memory retrieval issue listed in technical debt

### 5. CI/CD Updates (Low Priority)
- ✅ Update CI/CD pipeline to use Engram instead of CMB
- ✅ Add tests specific to Engram functionality
- ✅ Remove any CMB-specific test fixtures

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Now)
Focus on removing CMB fallback code while maintaining compatibility with existing agents:

1. Edit `engram_adapter.py`:
   ```python
   # Remove this block
   except ImportError:
       # Fallback to legacy CMB (temporary during migration)
       try:
           # Direct imports from legacy ClaudeMemoryBridge
           from cmb.cli.quickmem import (...)
   ```

2. Update environment variable handling:
   ```python
   # Change this
   ENGRAM_HTTP_URL=os.environ.get("ENGRAM_HTTP_URL", os.environ.get("CMB_HTTP_URL", DEFAULT_ENGRAM_HTTP_URL))
   
   # To this
   ENGRAM_HTTP_URL=os.environ.get("ENGRAM_HTTP_URL", DEFAULT_ENGRAM_HTTP_URL)
   ```

3. Simplify status checking:
   ```python
   # Remove pgrep check for cmb.api.consolidated_server
   # Only check for engram.api.consolidated_server
   ```

### Phase 2: Documentation & Cleanup (After Phase 1)
Focus on updating all documentation and cleaning up remaining references:

1. Update all docstrings to reference Engram
2. Remove historical CMB migration notes from code comments
3. Delete the `cmb_adapter.py` file completely

## Technical Debt to Address

### 1. Memory Retrieval Issues
- **Issue**: When using the retrieve_memory tool, the agent frequently makes multiple tool calls in a loop trying to find memories
- **Impact**: The agent hits the maximum tool call limit and fails to provide a useful response
- **Possible Solutions**:
  - Improve the fallback search implementation in `engram_adapter.py` to better match queries to stored memories
  - Add semantic search capability to the file-based fallback using a local embedding model
  - Enhance memory storage to include more structured metadata for better retrieval

### 2. Error Handling Improvements
- **Issue**: Error messages when Engram isn't installed are technical and not user-friendly
- **Impact**: Users may not understand what they need to do to enable memory functionality
- **Possible Solutions**:
  - Add more user-friendly error messages with specific installation instructions
  - Create a diagnostic tool to check Engram availability and provide guidance
  - Implement automatic detection and prompting for Engram installation

### 3. Documentation Enhancements
- **Issue**: Environment variable documentation needs improvement
- **Impact**: Users may not understand how to configure memory services properly
- **Possible Solutions**:
  - Create a dedicated documentation page for memory configuration
  - Add examples of different memory configurations
  - Document the fallback behavior and limitations

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered during the CMB code removal:
1. Revert to the previous version with dual Engram/CMB support
2. Check logs for specific errors related to Engram integration
3. Fix the issues in the context of the dual support model before attempting removal again
