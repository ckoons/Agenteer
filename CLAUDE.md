# Agenteer Development Notes

This file contains useful information about the Agenteer project structure, commands, and development notes.

## UI Styling

The Agenteer UI has been styled with the following color scheme:

- Main action buttons: Light Red/Orange (`#FF7043`) with darker hover effect (`#F4511E`)
- Navigation in sidebar: Specific colors for different expanders
- Recent Activity section: Collapsible expander with detail view

## GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration allows Agenteer to create agents that can interact with GitHub repositories.

### Key Components

- `agenteer/core/agents/generators/github_generator.py`: Defines GitHub tool functions and agent generation
- `agenteer/utils/config/settings.py`: Contains GitHub API configuration settings
- `github_agent.py`: Standalone GitHub agent with CLI interface
- `github_demo.py`: Simple demo script for GitHub API interactions

### GitHub Usage Examples

```bash
# Using the standalone GitHub agent
python github_agent.py --list                # List repositories
python github_agent.py --get REPO_NAME       # Get repository details
python github_agent.py --create NEW_REPO     # Create a new repository
python github_agent.py --delete REPO_NAME    # Delete a repository

# Using natural language
python github_agent.py "list repositories"
python github_agent.py "get repository details for Agenteer"
```

### GitHub Demo Usage

```bash
# Demo basic GitHub API functionality
python github_demo.py repos    # List repositories
python github_demo.py info     # Show user information
python github_demo.py events   # Show recent events
python github_demo.py stars    # List starred repositories
python github_demo.py orgs     # List organizations
```

## UI Structure

The Agenteer UI is built with Streamlit and organized into several pages:

- **Home**: Dashboard with quick actions and recent activity
- **Create Agent**: Form for creating new agents
- **My Agents**: Browse and interact with existing agents
- **Documentation**: Search, crawl, and browse documentation
- **Web Search**: Crawl and index external documentation
- **Settings**: Configure API keys, database, and other settings

## Common Commands

- Use `./run_ui.sh` script to suppress PyTorch warnings

#### Windows
- Use WSL2 for best compatibility
- Install Docker Desktop for Windows
- Running UI: `python -m agenteer.cli.main ui`

#### Linux
- Install Python 3.10+ and venv
- Follow standard installation process
- No special considerations needed

## Documentation Management

### Preloading Documentation

#### Common Patterns:

1. **Initial Setup**: When setting up a new Agenteer instance:
   ```bash
   # Preload all essential documentation
   agenteer preload-docs --timeout 300
   ```

2. **Focused Documentation**: When working with specific frameworks:
   ```bash
   # For Pydantic work
   agenteer preload-docs --source pydantic --max-pages 300
   
   # For LangChain projects
   agenteer preload-docs --source langchain --max-pages 300
   
   # For LangGraph projects
   agenteer preload-docs --source langgraph --max-pages 300
   
   # For Anthropic API development
   agenteer preload-docs --source anthropic --max-pages 300
   ```

3. **Docker Deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Preload in Docker container
   docker run --platform linux/arm64 agenteer preload-docs --timeout 600  # For Apple Silicon
   docker run --platform linux/amd64 agenteer preload-docs --timeout 600  # For Intel/AMD
   ```

4. **Checking Status**:
   ```bash
   # Verify documentation is loaded
   agenteer status
   ```

#### Best Practices:

- Set reasonable `max-pages` limits (100-300) to avoid excessive crawling
- Use longer timeouts (300-600 seconds) for complete documentation
- Preload only documentation relevant to your current project
- Run preloading during off-hours for large documentation sets
- Verify loaded documentation by checking status

## Environment Variables

Agenteer uses a hierarchical configuration system with environment variables loaded from multiple files in priority order:

1. `.env.owner`: Highest priority, personal settings not checked into version control
2. `.env.local`: Middle priority, machine-specific settings not checked into version control 
3. `.env`: Lowest priority, base configuration shared by all users

Values in earlier files override those in later files. All files are loaded, creating a cascading configuration system.

### Key Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI API key for OpenAI models | None |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key for Claude models | None |
| `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | Base URL for local Ollama instance | http://localhost:11434 |
| `DEFAULT_MODEL` | Default model to use when not specified | gpt-4o-mini |
| `AGENTEER_AUTHENTICATION` | Whether to require user authentication | true |
| `BROWSER_HEADLESS` | Run browser in headless mode | true |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, etc.) | INFO |

### Authentication Control

For testing and development, you can disable authentication:

```bash
# In .env file
AGENTEER_AUTHENTICATION=false

# Or on command line for a specific command
AGENTEER_AUTHENTICATION=false agenteer ui

# For testing
AGENTEER_AUTHENTICATION=false pytest tests/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### PyTorch Warnings
If you see warnings like `RuntimeError: Tried to instantiate class '__path__._path'...`:
- This is a known issue with PyTorch and Streamlit's file watcher
- Use the `./run_ui.sh` script which suppresses these warnings
- Install watchdog: `pip install watchdog`

#### Documentation Crawling Errors
If you see `Error processing URL...` messages:
- These are normal when crawling documentation sites
- Some pages may be unavailable or have moved
- The crawler will continue with available pages
- Check network connectivity if all URLs fail

#### Docker "Exec Format Error"
If you see `exec format error` when running Docker:
- Make sure to specify the correct platform flag
- For Apple Silicon: `--platform linux/arm64`
- For Intel/AMD: `--platform linux/amd64`

#### Port Already In Use
If you see `Bind for 0.0.0.0:8501 failed: port is already allocated`:
- Another instance of the UI is already running
- Run `docker ps` to find and stop the container
- Or use a different port: `-p 8502:8501`

## Latest Development Updates (March 13, 2025)

### Memory-Enabled Agents with mem0 (March 13, 2025)

**Project Goal**: Integrate memory capabilities using the mem0 library to enable Agenteer agents with long-term memory.

#### Implementation Summary

We've successfully integrated mem0 memory functionality into Agenteer with these components:

1. **Core Memory Service** (`agenteer/core/memory/service.py`)
   - Provides memory storage and retrieval capabilities
   - Works with both mem0 and a local fallback when mem0 is not available
   - Enables semantic search for relevant memories

2. **Nexus Agent Generator** (`agenteer/core/agents/generators/nexus/generator.py`)
   - Creates specialized memory-enabled agents
   - Adds memory-specific tools to agents
   - Maintains conversational context across sessions

3. **Runner Integration** (`agenteer/core/agents/runner.py`)
   - Enhances agent prompts with relevant memories
   - Automatically stores interactions in memory
   - Handles natural greetings without tool overhead
   - Optimized for memory-enabled agents

4. **CLI Command** (`agenteer/cli/commands/nexus.py`)
   - Dedicated `nexus` command for interacting with memory-enabled agents
   - Supports single-response mode with memory integration
   - Option to disable memory with `--no-memory` flag

#### Current Limitations and Fixes

1. **Interactive Mode**: The interactive CLI mode has some issues with tool execution and error handling. We need to investigate this further to provide a smooth interactive experience.

2. **mem0 Integration**: While the mem0 library provides extensive memory capabilities, we've implemented a simpler in-memory fallback solution for now to ensure compatibility across different environments. Full mem0 integration requires more testing.

3. **Tool Execution**: Memory-enabled agents sometimes get stuck in tool execution loops. We've implemented special handling for typical conversational patterns (greetings, memory queries) to bypass tool execution for these cases.

4. **Agent Generation Fix**: We've fixed a bug in the generator where it would fail when document metadata didn't include a 'title' field. The agent generator now includes a fallback for missing metadata titles.

#### Installation

To use memory capabilities with mem0, install the mem0 library:

```bash
pip install mem0ai==0.1.65
```

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Create a memory-enabled Nexus agent
agenteer create -n "MemoryAgent" -d "An agent with memory capabilities" -t nexus

# Chat with a Nexus agent (memory enabled by default)
agenteer nexus "MemoryAgent" -i "Hello, who are you?"

# Run a Nexus agent with memory disabled
agenteer nexus "MemoryAgent" -i "Tell me about yourself" --no-memory
```

#### Implementation Process and Learnings

The memory integration process involved several steps and taught us important lessons:

1. **Architecture Choices**
   - We chose a hybrid approach with both mem0 and a fallback implementation
   - The MemoryService provides a consistent interface regardless of backend
   - Memory enhancements are applied at the prompt level for simplicity

2. **Tool Management**
   - Memory-related tools needed special handling in the runner
   - We found that bypassing tools for conversational patterns works better
   - The runner detects agent type and conversation context to determine when to use memory features

3. **In-Memory Storage**
   - The fallback implementation stores memories in a simple dictionary
   - This provides basic functionality without external dependencies
   - While not as powerful as vector search, it demonstrates the concept effectively

#### Next Steps

1. **UI Integration**
   - Add memory visualization in Streamlit UI
   - Create memory management interface
   - Implement memory-based recommendations

2. **Enhanced Memory Features**
   - Add memory categorization
   - Implement memory pruning/cleanup
   - Support multi-user memory contexts

3. **Testing**
   - Create comprehensive memory service tests
   - Test with different vector stores
   - Benchmark memory retrieval performance

4. **Interactive Mode Fixes**
   - Debug and fix the interactive mode in the CLI
   - Implement proper error handling for tool execution
   - Add memory visualization in the CLI interface
   
5. **Dependency Cleanup**
   - Address deprecation warnings from numpy and pydantic
   - Update dependencies to newer versions
   - Fix SwigPyObject module warnings from FAISS

   - Outlook authentication requires manual code entry (needs improved UX)
   - Need to implement more robust error handling for timeouts
   - Need better handling of message attachments

### UI Integration

The Mail Agent will have dedicated UI components for better user experience:

1. **Mail Agent Creation Page**
   - Form to create a new Mail Agent with options for:
     - Provider selection (Gmail, Outlook)
     - Custom name and description
     - Access level configuration
     - Template selection

2. **Mail Agent UI Components**
   - Inbox view with sorting/filtering
   - Message detail view with HTML rendering
   - Compose email interface with rich text editor
   - Settings panel for provider configuration

3. **Implementation Plan**
   ```python
   # UI route for Mail Agent in streamlit_app.py
   elif page == "Mail":
       st.title("Mail Agent")
       
       # Check if authenticated
       if not mail_service.is_authenticated():
           st.warning("Please authenticate with your email provider")
           provider = st.selectbox("Select Provider", ["Gmail", "Outlook"])
           if st.button("Authenticate"):
               auth_url = mail_service.get_auth_url(provider.lower())
               st.markdown(f"[Click here to authenticate]({auth_url})")
       else:
           # Show inbox
           tab1, tab2, tab3 = st.tabs(["Inbox", "Compose", "Settings"])
           
           with tab1:
               messages = mail_service.get_inbox_messages()
               display_inbox(messages)
               
           with tab2:
               compose_email_form()
               
           with tab3:
               mail_settings()
   ```

4. **Agent Interaction Flows**
   - **Basic Mail Reading Flow**:
     1. User asks "Show me my recent emails"
     2. Agent uses get_inbox tool
     3. Agent formats and displays email summary
     4. User can click to view full email or reply
     
   - **Email Composition Flow**:
     1. User asks "Send an email to person@example.com"
     2. Agent prompts for subject and body
     3. Agent confirms before sending
     4. Agent sends email and confirms delivery

## Testing Plan

### Mail Agent Testing Progress

We've successfully implemented and tested the following components:

#### Phase 1 Testing (Main Branch) - March 10, 2025
1. **Unit Tests Created and Passing:**
   - `test_mail_tools.py` - Verifying mail tool definitions, registration, and basic functionality
   - `test_mail_service.py` - Testing the mail service initialization and configuration
   - `test_gmail_integration.py` - Testing Gmail provider functionality (authentication, reading inbox, sending messages)
   - `test_html_emails.py` - Testing HTML email formatting capabilities
   - `test_mail_generator.py` - Testing mail agent generation

2. **Agent Creation Successful:**
   - Created "TestMailAgent" with mail agent type
   - Ready for OAuth authentication testing

3. **Next Steps:**
   - Set up proper Gmail API credentials for OAuth testing
   - Test the complete OAuth authentication flow
   - Verify inbox reading functionality with real Gmail account
   - Test sending and replying to emails

#### Phase 2 Testing (Feature Branch)
1. **Outlook/Microsoft 365 Tests**
   - OAuth authentication flow for Microsoft
   - Reading Outlook inbox
   - Sending emails via Outlook
   - Replying to messages
   - Searching Outlook emails

2. **HTML Email Tests**
   - Sending emails with HTML formatting
   - Testing content type handling
   - Verifying HTML rendering in received emails
   - Testing HTML in replies

3. **Pending Feature Tests** (To be implemented)
   - Attachment handling
   - Email threading/conversation view
   - Draft management
   - Move/delete operations
   - Enhanced folder management

#### Test Implementation Plan

We need to create the following test files in the `tests/agents/mail/` directory:

```
tests/
  agents/
    mail/
      __init__.py
      test_gmail_integration.py    # Tests for Gmail provider
      test_outlook_integration.py  # Tests for Outlook provider
      test_html_emails.py          # Tests for HTML email functionality
      test_mail_tools.py           # Tests for mail tool definitions and registration
      test_mail_service.py         # Tests for MailService abstraction layer
      conftest.py                  # Shared fixtures for mail tests
```

The test files should use pytest fixtures to mock the email providers and avoid making actual API calls during testing. For manual testing with real APIs, we'll need to create separate integration test scripts.

#### Test Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/Agenteer.git
cd Agenteer

# Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Create test directory structure if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p tests/agents/mail

# Run tests once implemented
python -m pytest tests/agents/mail/test_mail_tools.py -v
python -m pytest tests/agents/mail/test_mail_service.py -v
python -m pytest tests/agents/mail/test_gmail_integration.py -v
python -m pytest tests/agents/mail/test_outlook_integration.py -v
python -m pytest tests/agents/mail/test_html_emails.py -v
```

#### Mock Testing vs. Real API Testing

For CI/CD pipelines, we'll use mock testing to avoid dependencies on external services. For development, we'll need to test with real email accounts:

1. **Mock Testing** (CI/CD-friendly)
   ```python
   # Example mock test for Gmail authentication
   def test_gmail_auth_flow(mocker):
       # Mock Gmail OAuth flow
       mock_flow = mocker.patch('google_auth_oauthlib.flow.InstalledAppFlow')
       mock_flow.from_client_secrets_file.return_value.run_local_server.return_value = mock_credentials
       
       # Test authentication
       provider = GmailProvider(credentials_file="test_creds.json")
       result = asyncio.run(provider.authenticate())
       
       assert result is True
       assert provider.credentials is not None
   ```

2. **Real API Testing** (Manual Development Testing)
   - Requires real Gmail/Outlook test accounts
   - Should be run manually, not in CI pipelines
   - Will need proper OAuth credentials configuration
   - Should clean up after tests (delete test emails, etc.)

## Browser Agent

The Browser Agent allows users to automate web browsing tasks via Agenteer. This integration was inspired by the OpenManus project.

### Key Components

- `agenteer/core/agents/browser/service.py`: Browser service using browser-use library
- `agenteer/core/agents/browser/tools.py`: Tool definitions for browser operations
- `agenteer/core/agents/browser/registry.py`: Tool registry and execution logic
- `agenteer/core/agents/generators/browser_generator.py`: Browser agent generator

### Browser Capabilities

The Browser Agent can:

1. Navigate to URLs
2. Extract text and HTML from web pages
3. Click on elements using CSS selectors
4. Type text into input fields
5. Take screenshots
6. Scroll web pages
7. Wait for specified times
8. Get information about elements on the page

### Setup and Usage

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install browser-use==0.1.40 playwright==1.49.1
playwright install

# Create a browser agent
agenteer create -n "WebBrowser" -d "Web browsing agent" -t browser

# Run the agent in interactive mode
agenteer run "WebBrowser" --interactive

# Example commands
"Go to github.com and find the trending repositories"
"Search for information about Agenteer on GitHub"
"Go to weather.com and get the forecast for San Francisco"
```

### Configuration

You can configure browser behavior in your .env file:
```
# Run browser headlessly (no visible window)
BROWSER_HEADLESS=true

# Run browser with visible window
BROWSER_HEADLESS=false
```

### Implementation Notes

This integration uses the browser-use library which in turn uses Playwright. The browser-use library provides a simplified interface for browser automation that works well with LLM agents.

## Flow System

The Flow System allows users to orchestrate multiple agents to tackle complex multi-step tasks. This integration was inspired by the OpenManus project's planning capabilities.

### Key Components

- `agenteer/core/flow/types.py`: Flow, Plan, and Step type definitions
- `agenteer/core/flow/base.py`: Base flow interface
- `agenteer/core/flow/planning.py`: Planning-based flow implementation
- `agenteer/core/flow/factory.py`: Factory for creating different flow types
- `agenteer/core/flow/tools.py`: Tools for working with plans

### Flow Capabilities

The Flow System can:

1. Create structured plans for complex tasks
2. Break down tasks into smaller, actionable steps
3. Match steps to appropriate specialized agents
4. Track plan execution progress
5. Handle step failures and retries
6. Provide detailed execution reports

### Flow Types

1. **Planning Flow**: LLM creates a detailed plan and executes it step by step
2. **Simple Flow**: Direct execution using a single agent (no planning)

### Setup and Usage

```bash
# Create different agent types for specialized tasks
agenteer create -n "WebBrowser" -d "Web browsing agent" -t browser
agenteer create -n "Researcher" -d "General purpose agent for research" -t standard
agenteer create -n "CodeHelper" -d "Code-focused assistant" -t standard

# Run a planning flow with specific agents
agenteer flow "Find latest Python tutorials on GitHub, summarize the top 3, and create a learning plan" --agent WebBrowser --agent Researcher --agent CodeHelper

# Run a planning flow with all available agents
agenteer flow "Research the latest trends in AI and create a summary report"

# Run a flow with a maximum step count
agenteer flow "Complex multi-step task" --max-steps 20

# Run a flow with a timeout
agenteer flow "Time-sensitive task" --timeout 300
```

### Implementation Notes

The planning flow works by:
1. Using an LLM to create a structured plan
2. Breaking the task into steps with agent type annotations
3. Executing each step with the most appropriate agent
4. Tracking progress and updating the plan
5. Generating a detailed summary report

Flow execution is fully configurable, with options for maximum steps, timeout, and agent selection.
