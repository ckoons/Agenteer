```

> **Note for Apple Silicon Mac users**: Be sure to include the `--platform linux/arm64` flag when building and running Docker images to ensure compatibility.

### Documentation Preloading

Agenteer offers built-in documentation preloading to enhance agent capabilities. There are several ways to preload documentation:

1. **Via the UI (Recommended)**: 
   Navigate to the Documentation or Web Search pages in the UI. If no documentation is found, you'll see a "Preload Essential Documentation" button that will automatically crawl and index documentation from Pydantic, LangChain, LangGraph, and Anthropic.

2. **Using the CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Preload all documentation sources
   agenteer preload-docs

   # Preload a specific source
   agenteer preload-docs --source pydantic
   agenteer preload-docs --source langchain
   agenteer preload-docs --source langgraph
   agenteer preload-docs --source anthropic

   # Customize crawling settings
   agenteer preload-docs --max-pages 500 --max-depth 4 --timeout 300
   ```

3. **With Docker**:
   ```bash
   # Preload all documentation sources
   docker run --platform linux/arm64 agenteer preload-docs  # For Apple Silicon Macs
   docker run --platform linux/amd64 agenteer preload-docs  # For Intel/AMD systems

   # Preload a specific source
   docker run --platform linux/arm64 agenteer preload-docs --source langchain  # For Apple Silicon
   docker run --platform linux/arm64 agenteer preload-docs --source langgraph  # For Apple Silicon
   ```

The preloaded documentation enables agents to leverage knowledge from these frameworks when responding to queries, making them more effective for framework-specific tasks.

Agenteer automatically caches documentation for faster preloading in future sessions. Cached documentation is stored in the `vector_store/doc_cache` directory and is valid for 7 days, after which it will be refreshed automatically. This ensures your documentation stays current while minimizing network usage.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- No external services required (uses SQLite by default)
- LLM API key (supports Claude, OpenAI, or local models via Ollama)

## UI Overview

The Agenteer UI is designed to be intuitive and streamlined:

- **Home**: Dashboard with quick actions and recent activity
- **Create Agent**: Form to create new agents with different capabilities
- **Existing Agents**: Browse and interact with your created agents
- **Documentation**: Search, crawl, and browse documentation
- **Web Search**: Crawl and index external documentation
- **Settings**: Configure API keys, database, and models

## Architecture

Agenteer consists of several core components:

1. **Core Engine**: Agent generation and execution logic
2. **Local Database**: SQLite-based storage for agents and sessions
3. **Vector Store**: FAISS-based document embedding and retrieval
4. **UI**: Streamlit-based web interface 
5. **CLI**: Command-line interface for automation and scripting
6. **API**: REST API for integration with other tools
7. **Documentation Crawler**: Tools for indexing documentation

## Configuration

Agenteer uses a hierarchical configuration system:

- `.env`: Base configuration shared by all users
- `.env.owner`: Personal settings (API keys, model preferences)
- `.env.local`: Local development settings

Example configuration:

```bash
# API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
OLLAMA_BASE_URL="http://localhost:11434"

# Model settings
DEFAULT_MODEL="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"
USE_LOCAL_MODELS=false
EMBEDDING_MODEL="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

# Application settings
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
DEBUG=false
```

## Working with Agents

Agenteer provides a unified interface for creating, running, and managing AI agents through both the CLI and web UI.

### Creating Agents

```bash
# Create a standard agent
agenteer create -n "MyAgent" -d "Description of the agent" -t standard

# Create a GitHub agent
agenteer create -n "GitHubAgent" -d "GitHub repository manager" -t github

# Create a Mail agent
agenteer create -n "MailAgent" -d "Email management assistant" -t mail
```

### Running Agents

There are several ways to run your agents:

```bash
# List available agents to get their IDs
agenteer list

# Run an agent with a specific input
agenteer run AGENT_ID -i "Your input here"

# Run an agent in interactive mode (conversation)
agenteer run AGENT_ID --interactive

# Run an agent with a timeout (30 seconds)
agenteer run AGENT_ID -i "Your input here" --timeout 30

# Set timeout action (log, alarm, or kill)
agenteer run AGENT_ID -i "Your input here" --timeout 30 --timeout-action alarm
```

### Agent Timeout Management

Agenteer provides built-in timeout functionality to monitor and control agent executions:

#### Timeout Options

- `--timeout <seconds>`: Set a maximum execution time in seconds
- `--timeout-action <action>`: Specify what happens when timeout occurs:
  - `log`: Record timeout in logs and return a gentle message (default)
  - `alarm`: Record timeout and return a more prominent warning message
  - `kill`: Terminate the agent execution and return an error message

#### Use Cases

- **Resource Management**: Prevent runaway agents from consuming excessive resources
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track how long agents take to complete tasks
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Ensure batch operations complete within time constraints
- **Production Reliability**: Implement circuit breakers for mission-critical agent tasks

#### Examples

```bash
# Set a 30-second timeout with default "log" action
agenteer run AGENT_ID -i "Research quantum computing" --timeout 30

# Use "alarm" action to get a more noticeable timeout warning
agenteer run AGENT_ID -i "Analyze this dataset" --timeout 60 --timeout-action alarm

# Use "kill" action to forcibly terminate long-running operations
agenteer run AGENT_ID -i "Complex task" --timeout 120 --timeout-action kill
```

### Managing Agents

You can manage your agents with the following commands:

```bash
# List all agents
agenteer list

# Delete an agent (with confirmation prompt)
agenteer delete AGENT_ID

# Force delete an agent without confirmation
agenteer delete AGENT_ID --force
```

### Using the Web UI

You can launch the web UI to interact with your agents in a more user-friendly interface:

```bash
agenteer ui
```

The web UI provides several ways to work with agents:

#### Running Agents in the UI

   - Run the agent: `agenteer run AGENT_ID --interactive`

3. **Using the standalone script**:
   ```bash
   # Using the standalone GitHub agent
   python github_agent.py --list                # List repositories
   python github_agent.py --get REPO_NAME       # Get repository details
   python github_agent.py --create NEW_REPO     # Create a new repository

   # Using natural language
   python github_agent.py "list repositories"
   ```

#### Mail Agents
Email integration agents that can read, send, and manage emails. These agents can:

- Connect to Gmail or Outlook/Microsoft 365 accounts
- Read messages from your inbox
- Send new emails with HTML formatting
- Reply to existing conversations 
- Search for specific emails
- View email folders/labels

You can use Mail agents in two ways:

1. **Through the UI**:
   - Create a Mail agent in the "Create Agent" page by selecting the Mail agent type
   - Run the agent from the "My Agents" page and interact with it via chat
